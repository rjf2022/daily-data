# Exploratory Analysis in Power BI 

This [blog post](https://dailydataapps.com/fbl-exploratory-analysis-in-power-bi/) showcases a Power BI report that we created for some quick exploratory analysis on our fantasy basketball stats. 

We uploaded the .pbix file to this folder for you to download and try out for yourself (note that we truncated the data in it to avoid violating the API's terms of use, but you can learn how to get the data yourself from our other posts in the series).
