# Fantasy Basketball Optimization Project 

This folder contains all the code for our [Fantasy Basketball Optimization](https://dailydataapps.com/fantasy-basketball-optimization/) project where we built an automated cloud pipeline to help win our fantasy basketball league with data science. 

We walk through the whole project in a series of posts on our Daily Data blog, and each subfolder in here corresponds to a blog post in the series (note that we're still finishing up some of the posts in the series).
